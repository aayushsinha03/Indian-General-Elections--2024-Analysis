# Indian-General-Elections--2024-Analysis
SQL + Python + Power BI based analysis of 2024 Indian General Election Results with alliance-wise insights and interactive dashboard.
## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to perform an end-to-end data analysis of the 2024 Indian General Election results to uncover insights on party-wise, alliance-wise, and state-wise seat distribution.
It involves using SQL for data extraction and transformation, Python (pandas) for exploratory data analysis (EDA), and Power BI to build an interactive, multi-page dashboard that visualizes the performance of key political alliances such as NDA and I.N.D.I.A.
## ðŸ’» Technologies & Tools Used

ðŸ”¹ **Python**  
Used for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and static visualizations.

ðŸ”¹ **Pandas**  
Handled data cleaning, transformation, and merging multiple datasets for analysis.

ðŸ”¹ **SQL**  
Performed alliance-wise and state-wise seat aggregation, filtering, and joins to extract structured insights.

ðŸ”¹ **Matplotlib & Seaborn**  
Created visualizations such as bar plots and pie charts to represent seat distribution and performance comparisons.

ðŸ”¹ **Power BI**  
Built an interactive multi-page dashboard to showcase insights like NDA vs I.N.D.I.A. performance, state-wise wins, and party-level statistics.

ðŸ”¹ **Jupyter Notebook**  
Used as the primary development environment for writing and running Python EDA code.
